This site is (clearly) a work in progress, but I'm working on some blog posts that will begin to appear soon: 

 * Introduction to integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) for applied users 
 * Vector velocity mapping for infectious disease spread: applications and my forthcoming <texttt> outbreakvelocity </texttt>R package 
 * Vignette on using  <texttt> sqldf </texttt> in R  
 * Making a custom website using R markdown/knitr and github pages (like this one!)

Suggestions welcome!
